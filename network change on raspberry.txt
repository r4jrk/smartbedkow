wpa_supplicant.conf
Let’s see how to do this:

Open your favorite text editor on your computer.
The basic editor from your operating system will be fine (Notepad for example).
Copy and paste these lines into it:
country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
  ssid="YOURSSID"
  scan_ssid=1
  psk="YOURPASSWORD"
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
Replace variables with your SSID and password, and change the country value if needed.
Save the file on a location you can find easily the next time you create a new SD card.
Insert your SD card into your computer (for a fresh new SD card created with Etcher, you have to eject and insert it again).
Then copy the wpa_supplicant.conf file to the boot partition.

It works with any Raspberry Pi OS version (Desktop or Lite).
So, it’s perfect for any use.
